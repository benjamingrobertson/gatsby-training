## Building a Decoupled Drupal Website with Gatsby

A training workshop by [Mediacurrent](https://mediacurrent.com).

This is a hands-on training in which we will build a decoupled Drupal website with a React/Gatsby front-end.

### What is Gatsby?

Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build fast **websites** and **apps.**

### **Why Gatsby?**

Gatsby offer many advantages over a traditional Drupal front-end.  One of them being an extremely fast page loading experience as Gatsby generates static pages from your data.  In addition, since we are loading static pages and not database-queried pages, the security benefits of this approach make gatsby an appealing choice.
